# password-strength-checker
A simple Python program that evaluates password strength based on length and character variety.


In this example, the user typed the password password.
Password length = 8 characters.
Just at the minimum acceptable length.
Variety score = 1 out of 4.
The password only has lowercase letters.
No uppercase, no digits, no symbols.
Final rating = WEAK.
Even though the length is 8 (which could be “medium”), the lack of variety makes it very weak and easy to guess.

In this example, the user typed the password P@ssword123456.
Password length = 14 characters.
Long enough to provide strong protection.
Variety score = 4 out of 4.
Contains lowercase letters (assword),
uppercase letters (P),
digits (123456),
and symbols (@).
Final rating = STRONG.
The password meets both the length and variety requirements, so it is classified as strong.
